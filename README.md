# SSNCC - Semi-Supervised Normalized Cut Clustering

## Description

This formulation extends the fully unsupervised Normalized Cut Clustering (NCC) approach to the framework of semi-supervised clustering (SSNCC). That is when prior knowledge about the labels is available. Also, SSNCC reduces itself to the conventional NCC approach when no prior knowledge is available.

## Installation

To use the SSNCC algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.

## Usage
You can utilize the SSNCC algorithm by following the example provided in the code. Make sure to set the required parameters and input data correctly to obtain the desired clustering results.
