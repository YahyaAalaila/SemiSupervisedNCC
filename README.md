# SemiSupervisedNCC
This formulation extends the fully unsupervised Normalized Cut Clustering (NCC) approach to the framework of semi-supervised clustering (SSNCC). That is when prior knowledge about the labels is available. Also, SSNCC reduces itself to the conventional NCC approach when no prior knowledge is available.

This code was used in the experiments provided by the following preprint:
